This is the simplest case but present in our day-to-day lives in many ways: from laser printing to explaining static cling (see Figure 2.1).\nAs you may already know, subatomic particles like the proton and electrons, have a physical property called electric charge.

Even though it looks like a simple rewriting of the equation, it provides a very valuable new point of view.\n\nDefinition 2.3 (Electric field) Given a set of charges q_i at positions {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i, with i \\in {1, \\dots, N}, we define the electric field at a given point {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3 as\n{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_i}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i|^2}\\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i|}. \\tag{2.3}\n\nThe electric field can be interpreted as the force that a unit test charge (that is, a virtual charge with q=1) would experience at the point in space {\\boldsymbol{r}}. It is called a test charge as its charge is not part of the set of charges we are considering (we use it only to “test” how the set of charges behaves). The electric field is a vector field defined in {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{{\\boldsymbol{r}}_1, \\dots, {\\boldsymbol{r}}_N\\}.\n\nRemark 2.2.

You are probably familiar with the concept of potential, for example the gravitational potential. In a similar manner, we can define the electrostatic potential.\n\nDefinition 2.4 (Electrostatic potential) The electrostatic potential for a given electric field {\\boldsymbol{E}} is defined as the function \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R} such that {\\boldsymbol{E}}= -\\nabla \\phi.\n\n\nTheorem 2.1 For a single point charge q at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 the electrostatic potential is given by\n \\phi({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0|}. \\tag{2.4}\n\nThe proof immediately follows from applying Definition 2.4 to Equation 2.4.

    "text": "2.3 Gauss’ law for point charges\nAs we said earlier, the definition of the electric field is a lot more than a simple relabelling, and in this section we will see why. Before that, we need to recall a definition from vector calculus.\n\nDefinition 2.5 (Flux) Given a surface \\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 with outward3 unit normal vector {\\boldsymbol{n}}, we define the flux of the electric field {\\boldsymbol{E}} through \\Sigma as the integral \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}S.\n\nWith this definition, we can now state one of the central results of electrostatics\n\nTheorem 2.2 (Gauss’ law) For any closed surface \\Sigma = \\partial \\Omega (that is the surface bounding a region \\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3), we have\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i, \\tag{2.5}\nwhere q_i is the set of charges contained in \\Omega. For convenience, we define the total charge in \\Omega as Q = \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i.\n\n\nProof. Let’s start by considering a single point charge q at a position {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0. Without loss of generality, we can assume {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 = {\\boldsymbol{0}} as we can always perform a change of coordinates. From Equation 2.3 we find that the charge produces an electric field\n {\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^3}. Let’s also consider a ball of arbitrary radius R &gt; 0 centred at the origin B_R, the flux of the electric field through its surface is4\n \\int_{\\partial B_R} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_{\\partial B_R} \\frac{1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^2} {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi R^2 \\epsilon_0} \\int_{\\partial B_R} {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}. \\tag{2.6}\nThis resembles the Gauss’ law, but for a single charge and a very specific surface, so we now need to generalise the result. From the divergence theorem REF, for an arbitrary domain \\Omega bounded by \\Sigma = \\partial \\Omega we have\n \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\Sigma} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A.\nLet’s now compute the divergence of the electric field\n \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{3}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^3} - \\frac{3}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^3}\\right) = 0, \\tag{2.7}\nand note we have used add relevant references from Chapter 1. However, the electric field is singular at {\\boldsymbol{r}}= {\\boldsymbol{0}}, so we can only state that the divergence of the electric field is zero for {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{{\\boldsymbol{0}}\\}.\nNow let’s consider assume our arbitrary domain \\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 contains the ball B_R. The integral of Equation 2.7 over \\Omega can be split into\n\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus B_R} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V + \\int_{B_R} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nThe first term is zero, as it the integration domain does not contain the origin, while we can apply the divergence theorem to the second term, obtaining\n\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{B_R} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\partial B_R} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}, \\tag{2.8}\nwhere in the final step we have used Equation 2.6. Therefore\n \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}. \\tag{2.9}\nNow consider a distribution of N charges q_i located at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i, respectively. By the principle of superposition Equation 2.2 we can write the electric field as the sum of the contributions for each charge. Then, similar to Equation 2.7, we can show that the divergence of the electric field will be zero in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\bigcup_i {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i. Defining as B_i the ball of arbitrary radius R centred at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i (i.e. around charge q_i), we can write\n\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^N B_i} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\int_{B_i} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nThe first term is still zero as it doesn’t include any of the charges. For each ball B_i we only need to consider the contribution of the charge q_i as it is the only singularity of the electric field in that ball, so Equation 2.8 generalises into\n \\int_{B_i} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V  = \\int_{\\partial B_i} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q_i}{\\epsilon_0}.\nTherefore, we conclude\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{q_i}{\\epsilon_0}.",

    "section": "2.4 Charge density",
    "text": "2.4 Charge density\nSo far we have worked with a set of point charges. However, this is quite often impractical. For example, a macroscopic object has an enormous number of electrons and protons so it is not reasonable to consider them one by one. A more subtle point is that, from a quantum mechanics point of view, the position of electron be determined and instead they should be treated as a “blur” of charge. In either case, the concept of charge density comes handy.\n\nDefinition 2.6 (Charge density) We define the charge density as a function \\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}): \\Omega \\in \\mathbf{R}^3 \\to \\mathbf{R} that gives the charge per unit volume at a certain point in space.\nWe can then define the total charge in any arbitrary region \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 as\nQ = \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we will assume that any charge density function \\rho we encounter in this module is, at least, continuous. We will also assume that \\rho has support \\Omega and that it is bounded. We can now redefine the electric field Equation 2.3 in terms of the charge density.\n\nDefinition 2.7 (Electric field) Given a charge density \\rho : \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}, we define the electric field at a given point {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3 as\n {\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}')}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|^2} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} {\\mathrm{d}}V', \\tag{2.10}\nwhere {\\mathrm{d}}V' is the infinitesimal volume element related to {\\boldsymbol{r}}'.\n\nSimilarly, we can redefine the electrostatic potential for a charge density.\n\nTheorem 2.3 (Electrostatic potential) The electrostatic potential for a charge density \\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}) is given by\n \\phi({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}')}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} {\\mathrm{d}}V'. \\tag{2.11}\n\n\nRemark 2.3. It’s worth pointing out that, as \\rho has compact support, \\phi \\sim r^{-1} as |{\\boldsymbol{r}}| \\to \\infty and thus it vanishes.\n\nThe proof also follows directly from Definition 2.4. Note that, when taking the gradient of \\phi, it acts on {\\boldsymbol{r}} only ({\\boldsymbol{r}}' is the integration variable and thus it’s “invisible” from outside the integral).\nIt should come as no surprise that we can also rewrite Gauss’ law for a charge density.\n\nTheorem 2.4 (Gauss’ law) For any closed surface \\Sigma = \\partial \\Omega (that is the surface bounding a region \\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3), we have\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\, {\\mathrm{d}}V, \\tag{2.12}\nwhere \\rho : \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R} is the charge density in \\Omega. For convenience, we define the total charge in \\Omega as Q = \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\n\nUsing the divergence theorem on Equation 2.12 and rearranging we can write\n \\int_\\Omega \\left(\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}- \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) {\\mathrm{d}}V = 0,\nand given that this holds for any arbitrary domain \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 we obtain the Gauss’ law in differential form.\n\nTheorem 2.5 (Gauss’ law - differential form) The electric field generated by a given charge density \\rho : \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R} satisfies\n \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}. \\tag{2.13}\nThis is the first of the Maxwell’s equations (Equation 1.1).\n\nWe have now two sets of definitions for electric field and Gauss’ law: one for point charges and one for charge densities. But how do they relate to each other? The key is the Dirac delta function.\n\nDefinition 2.8 (Dirac delta function - 1D) The Dirac delta function \\delta(x) in 1D is defined to satisfy the following properties:\n \\delta (x) = 0 \\quad \\text{ if } x \\neq 0,\nand\n\\int_I \\delta(x) {\\mathrm{d}}x = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } 0 \\in I,\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases} \nIn words, it is a function that is equal to zero everywhere except at the origin (where it is infinitely large), and its integral over \\mathbb{R} (or any interval I containing the origin) is equal to one.\n\n\nRemark 2.4. One way of thinking about the Dirac delta is as the limit of a Gaussian probability distribution centred at the origin when the variance tends to zero (i.e. when you “squeeze” it).\n\n\nProposition 2.1 The Dirac delta function satisfies:\n\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = f(x') \\delta(x' - x) {\\mathrm{d}}x' = f(x),\n\\delta ( a x ) = \\frac{1}{|a|} \\delta(x),\n\\int_{-\\infty}^x \\delta(x') {\\mathrm{d}}x' = H(x),\n\nwhere f(x) is any continuous function, a \\neq 0 is a constant and H(x) is the Heaviside step function.\n\nThe proofs for these properties follow immediately from Definition 2.8. We can generalise the definition of the Dirac delta function to higher dimensions\n\nDefinition 2.9 (Dirac delta function) The n-dimensional version Dirac delta function \\delta: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} is defined as\n \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\Pi_{i = 1}^n \\delta(x_i) = \\delta(x_1) \\delta(x_2) \\dots \\delta(x_n),\nwhere {\\boldsymbol{r}}= (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) in Cartesian coordinates.\n\n\nProposition 2.2 The Dirac delta function in n-dimensions satisfies the properties\n\n \\delta ({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = 0 \\quad \\text{ if } {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\neq {\\boldsymbol{0}},\n\\int_\\Omega \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}) {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } {\\boldsymbol{0}}\\in \\Omega,\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise},\\end{cases} \n\\int_\\Omega  f({\\boldsymbol{r}}') \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}' - {\\boldsymbol{r}}) {\\mathrm{d}}V = f({\\boldsymbol{r}}),\n\n\nLet’s now get back to the connection between point charges and charge densities. We can think of a point charge q at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 as a charge density\n\\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = q \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0). \\tag{2.14}\nSubstituting this definition in Equation 2.10 we obtain\n{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\frac{q \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}' -{\\boldsymbol{r}}_0)}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|^2} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}-{\\boldsymbol{r}}'}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} {\\mathrm{d}}V' = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0|^2} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}-\\ bfr_0|},\nwhich corresponds to Equation 2.3 for a single point charge. We can proceed similarly for the electrostatic potential.\nFor the Gauss’ law, we can substitute Equation 2.14 into Equation 2.12 and obtain\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega q \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0) {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0},\nas, by assumption, {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 \\in \\Omega. Therefore, we have recovered Equation 2.5 for a single point charge.",

    "text": "2.5 More on the electrostatic potential\nLet’s turn our attention back to the electrostatic potential. In Definition 2.4 we defined it in terms of the electric field, but it’s usually more convenient to compute it directly from the charge density.\n\nProposition 2.3 The electrostatic potential satisfies\n \\nabla ^ 2 \\phi = - \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}.\nThis equation is known as Poisson’s equation.\n\n\nProof. Substituting Definition 2.4 into Equation 2.13 we get\n\\nabla \\cdot \\left( - \\nabla \\phi \\right) = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0},\nand thus\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = - \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}.\n\nThere is another interesting implication stemming from the definition of electrostatic potential. If {\\boldsymbol{E}}= - \\nabla \\phi we have\n\\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\times \\left( \\nabla \\phi \\right) = 0, \\tag{2.15}\nas the curl of a gradient is always zero CROSSREF. Note that this is the steady-state version of the second of the Maxwell’s equations Equation 1.2 (i.e. when \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{B}}}{\\partial t} = 0).\nYou may recall, for example when studying gravity, that when a force can be defined as the gradient of a scalar function (i.e. a potential), then the force is called conservative. Given that the electrostatic force is given by {\\boldsymbol{F}}= q {\\boldsymbol{E}}, and {\\boldsymbol{E}}= - \\nabla \\phi, it must be conservative. Then, we can compute the work5 done against the electrostatic force for a charge q moving along a path C starting at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{i} and ending at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{f} is\n W = - \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{F}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{s}}= - q \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{s}}= q \\int_C \\nabla \\phi \\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{s}}= q ( \\phi ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{f} - \\phi ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{i}))). \\tag{2.16}\nTherefore, we deduce that the work done does not depend on the path C, only on its start and end points, and we can conclude that the electrostatic force is conservative.\n\nRemark 2.5. Note that the electrostatic potential is defined up to a constant. This means that, if \\phi is a potential for a given electric field {\\boldsymbol{E}}, then \\hat{\\phi} = \\phi + c (where c is a constant) is also a potential for {\\boldsymbol{E}}. Therefore, the quantity that is well-defined (and we can measure) physically is the potential difference between two points, which we call voltage.\nWhen working with electrostatic potentials, it is up to us to define a reference for the potential, that is the value of the potential at a given point, which allows us to fix the constant. For example, in Definition 2.4 we assumed that the potential is zero as |{\\boldsymbol{r}}| \\to \\infty.\n\n\nDefinition 2.10 (Field lines) Given a vector field, a field line is a line that at each point is tangent to the vector field.6\n\nField lines are a very useful way to visualise electric (and magnetic) fields.\n\nDefinition 2.11 (Equipotential surfaces) Surfaces of constant \\phi are called equipotentials.7\n\n\nProposition 2.4 The electric field (i.e. the field lines) are always normal to an equipotential surface.\n\n\nProof. Define {\\boldsymbol{t}} to be a tangent vector to the equipotential at a given point {\\boldsymbol{r}}. From the definition of the equipotential, we know that the derivative of \\phi in the tangent direction {\\boldsymbol{t}} must be zero (as the potential is constant along an equipotential surface). Thus (\\nabla \\phi) \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{t}}= 0 and from the definition of the electrostatic potential we conclude that {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot \\nabla \\phi = 0 so the electric field is perpendicular to the equipotential surface (and so are the field lines).",

Its potential is\n \\phi_1 = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1|}. \nNow let’s consider a charge q_2, which we move from infinity to a point {\\boldsymbol{r}}_2. From Equation 2.16, the work done against the electric field is\n W_2 = q_2 \\phi_1({\\boldsymbol{r}}_2) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_2 q_1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_2 - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1|}.\nLet’s now do the same for a charge q_3 that needs to be placed at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_3, in the presence of q_1 and q_2:\nW_3 = q_3 (\\phi_1 ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_3) + \\phi_2 ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_3)) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q_3 q_1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_3 - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1} + \\frac{q_3 q_2}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_3 - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_2|} \\right),\nwhich we deduce fro the principle of superposition (\\phi_2 is the potential of the charge q_2). The total work done so far is W = W_2 + W_3. By induction, we can deduce that for N charges q_1, \\dots, q_N at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1,\\dots,{\\boldsymbol{r}}_N the total work to assemble them is\n W = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j &lt; i} \\frac{q_i q_j}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_i - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_j|}.\nBy symmetry on i and j, we can write\nW = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{q_i q_j}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_i - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_j|}.\nRewriting it in terms of electrostatic potentials we get\nW = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i \\phi^{(i)}, \\tag{2.17}\nwhere\n\\phi^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{q_j}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_i - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_j|} \\tag{2.18}\nis defined as the potential generated by all charges except for q_i evaluated at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i.\nNow let’s take the continuum limit, to consider the potential created by a charge density instead (Equation 2.11). Then Equation 2.17 becomes\nW = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\phi {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nUsing Gauss’ law (#eq-Gauss-law-charge-density) and some basic vector calculus identities, we obtain\n\\phi \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} = \\phi \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}) - \\nabla \\phi \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}) + {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}) + | {\\boldsymbol{E}}|^2.\nSubstituting into Equation 2.18 and using the divergence theorem we get\nW = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\left( \\int_\\Sigma \\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A + \\int_\\Omega  \n| {\\boldsymbol{E}}|^2 {\\mathrm{d}}V \\right). \\tag{2.19}\nAs we want to know the energy of the whole charge configuration, we take \\Omega to be a ball centred at the origin with radius r. Taking the limit r \\to \\infty and recalling that in that limit \\phi \\sim \\frac{1}{r}, the surface integral term vanishes, and Equation 2.19 reduces to\n W = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\int_{{\\mathbb{R}}^3} | {\\boldsymbol{E}}|^2 {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nIf the integral exists, we say that the charge configuration has finite energy W.\n\nDefinition 2.12 (Energy density) The energy density of a charge configuration is defined by\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} | {\\boldsymbol{E}}|^2,\nand the total energy of the configuration can be written as\nW = \\int_{{\\mathbb{R}}^3} \\mathcal{E} {\\mathrm{d}}V.",
