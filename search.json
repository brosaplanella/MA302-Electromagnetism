    "text": "Aims and structure\nThe main aims of this module are:\n\nProvide the student with the background necessary to understand basic electromagnetism concepts and Maxwell’s equations.\nApply this knowledge to write and solve models for simple electromagnetism setups.\nHighlight the connections of electromagnetism to practical applications in our day-to-day lives.\n\nWe will look at electromagnetism from a mathematical perspective, and use it to better understand the world around us, which is what applied mathematics is about.\nIn 1  Introduction to electromagnetism we will provide some motivation to the topic and recap some basic results from vector calculus that we will use in this module.\nWe will start with electrostatics in 2  Electrostatics, which is the study of static electric charges. We will introduce some fundamental concepts like electric charge, electric field and electrostatic potential; and derive some results like Gauss’ law. In ?sec-applications-electrostatics we will put into practice what we learned about electrostatics, by developing some concepts further and using them to understand some real applications, like conductors or capacitors.\nNext, we will turn our attention to magnetostatics (3  Magnetostatics), which is the study of steady magnetic fields. As magnetic fields are produced by charges in motion, we will introduce the concepts of current and current density. We will also derive some key results, like the Biot-Savart law, Gauss’law for magnetism or Ampère’s law. Similarly to electrostatics, in ?sec-applications-magnetostatics we will focus on applications of magnetostatics.\nIn 4  Electrodynamics we will bring time into the equation, and generalise our previous results to allow for time-dependence, leading to the Maxwell’s equations. We will talk about induction and displacement currents, but the spotlight will be on light1. We will derive the governing equation for electromagnetic waves, and introduce some results, though if you want to learn a lot more about wave you should probably sign up for MA301 Waves and Metamaterials.\nWe will conclude with ?sec-matter, in which we will extend the Maxwell’s equations to account for real macroscale materials, rather than just charges in motion, and explain some of the phenomena that arise.\nThis is the first time I teach this module, and there will doubtless be errors and typos in these notes. There are also probably sections that could be better explained. If you spot anything or you have any suggestions, please do let me know via email.\nDr Ferran Brosa Planella, Autumn 2025",

    "text": "2.3 Gauss’ law for point charges\nAs we said earlier, the definition of the electric field is a lot more than a simple relabelling, and in this section we will see why. Before that, we need to recall a definition from vector calculus.\n\nDefinition 2.5 (Flux) Given a surface \\Sigma \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 with outward3 unit normal vector {\\boldsymbol{n}}, we define the flux of the electric field {\\boldsymbol{E}} through \\Sigma as the integral \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}S.\n\nWith this definition, we can now state one of the central results of electrostatics\n\nTheorem 2.2 (Gauss’ law) For any closed surface \\Sigma = \\partial \\Omega (that is the surface bounding a region \\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3), we have\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i, \\tag{2.5}\nwhere q_i is the set of charges contained in \\Omega. For convenience, we define the total charge in \\Omega as Q = \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i.\n\n\nProof. Let’s start by considering a single point charge q at a position {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0. Without loss of generality, we can assume {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 = {\\boldsymbol{0}} as we can always perform a change of coordinates. From Equation 2.3 we find that the charge produces an electric field\n {\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^3}. Let’s also consider a ball of arbitrary radius R &gt; 0 centred at the origin B_R, the flux of the electric field through its surface is4\n \\int_{\\partial B_R} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_{\\partial B_R} \\frac{1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^2} {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{4 \\pi R^2 \\epsilon_0} \\int_{\\partial B_R} {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}. \\tag{2.6}\nThis resembles the Gauss’ law, but for a single charge and a very specific surface, so we now need to generalise the result. From the divergence theorem REF, for an arbitrary domain \\Omega bounded by \\Sigma = \\partial \\Omega we have\n \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\Sigma} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A.\nLet’s now compute the divergence of the electric field\n \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{3}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^3} - \\frac{3}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}|^3}\\right) = 0, \\tag{2.7}\nand note we have used add relevant references from Chapter 1. However, the electric field is singular at {\\boldsymbol{r}}= {\\boldsymbol{0}}, so we can only state that the divergence of the electric field is zero for {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\{{\\boldsymbol{0}}\\}.\nNow let’s consider assume our arbitrary domain \\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 contains the ball B_R. The integral of Equation 2.7 over \\Omega can be split into\n\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus B_R} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V + \\int_{B_R} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nThe first term is zero, as it the integration domain does not contain the origin, while we can apply the divergence theorem to the second term, obtaining\n\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{B_R} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\partial B_R} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}, \\tag{2.8}\nwhere in the final step we have used Equation 2.6. Therefore\n \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0}. \\tag{2.9}\nNow consider a distribution of N charges q_i located at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i, respectively. By the principle of superposition Equation 2.2 we can write the electric field as the sum of the contributions for each charge. Then, similar to Equation 2.7, we can show that the divergence of the electric field will be zero in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\bigcup_i {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i. Defining as B_i the ball of arbitrary radius R centred at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i (i.e. around charge q_i), we can write\n\\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\int_{\\Omega \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^N B_i} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\int_{B_i} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nThe first term is still zero as it doesn’t include any of the charges. For each ball B_i we only need to consider the contribution of the charge q_i as it is the only singularity of the electric field in that ball, so Equation 2.8 generalises into\n \\int_{B_i} \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}V  = \\int_{\\partial B_i} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{q_i}{\\epsilon_0}.\nTherefore, we conclude\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{q_i}{\\epsilon_0}.",

    "section": "2.4 Charge density",
    "text": "2.4 Charge density\nSo far we have worked with a set of point charges. However, this is quite often impractical. For example, a macroscopic object has an enormous number of electrons and protons so it is not reasonable to consider them one by one. A more subtle point is that, from a quantum mechanics point of view, the position of electron be determined and instead they should be treated as a “blur” of charge. In either case, the concept of charge density comes handy.\n\nDefinition 2.6 (Charge density) We define the charge density as a function \\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}): \\Omega \\in \\mathbf{R}^3 \\to \\mathbf{R} that gives the charge per unit volume at a certain point in space.\nWe can then define the total charge in any arbitrary region \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 as\nQ = \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, we will assume that any charge density function \\rho we encounter in this module is, at least, continuous. We will also assume that \\rho has support \\Omega and that it is bounded. We can now redefine the electric field Equation 2.3 in terms of the charge density.\n\nDefinition 2.7 (Electric field) Given a charge density \\rho : \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R}, we define the electric field at a given point {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\in \\mathbb{R}^3 as\n {\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}')}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|^2} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} {\\mathrm{d}}V', \\tag{2.10}\nwhere {\\mathrm{d}}V' is the infinitesimal volume element related to {\\boldsymbol{r}}'.\n\nSimilarly, we can redefine the electrostatic potential for a charge density.\n\nTheorem 2.3 (Electrostatic potential) The electrostatic potential for a charge density \\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}) is given by\n \\phi({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}')}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} {\\mathrm{d}}V'. \\tag{2.11}\n\n\nRemark 2.3. It’s worth pointing out that, as \\rho has compact support, \\phi \\sim r^{-1} as |{\\boldsymbol{r}}| \\to \\infty and thus it vanishes.\n\nThe proof also follows directly from Definition 2.4. Note that, when taking the gradient of \\phi, it acts on {\\boldsymbol{r}} only ({\\boldsymbol{r}}' is the integration variable and thus it’s “invisible” from outside the integral).\nIt should come as no surprise that we can also rewrite Gauss’ law for a charge density.\n\nTheorem 2.4 (Gauss’ law) For any closed surface \\Sigma = \\partial \\Omega (that is the surface bounding a region \\Omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^3), we have\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\, {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\, {\\mathrm{d}}V, \\tag{2.12}\nwhere \\rho : \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R} is the charge density in \\Omega. For convenience, we define the total charge in \\Omega as Q = \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\, {\\mathrm{d}}V.\n\nUsing the divergence theorem on Equation 2.12 and rearranging we can write\n \\int_\\Omega \\left(\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}- \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) {\\mathrm{d}}V = 0,\nand given that this holds for any arbitrary domain \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 we obtain the Gauss’ law in differential form.\n\nTheorem 2.5 (Gauss’ law - differential form) The electric field generated by a given charge density \\rho : \\Omega \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3 \\to \\mathbb{R} satisfies\n \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}. \\tag{2.13}\nThis is the first of the Maxwell’s equations (Equation 1.1).\n\nWe have now two sets of definitions for electric field and Gauss’ law: one for point charges and one for charge densities. But how do they relate to each other? The key is the Dirac delta function.\n\nDefinition 2.8 (Dirac delta function - 1D) The Dirac delta function \\delta(x) in 1D is defined to satisfy the following properties:\n \\delta (x) = 0 \\quad \\text{ if } x \\neq 0,\nand\n\\int_I \\delta(x) {\\mathrm{d}}x = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } 0 \\in I,\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\\end{cases} \nIn words, it is a function that is equal to zero everywhere except at the origin (where it is infinitely large), and its integral over \\mathbb{R} (or any interval I containing the origin) is equal to one.\n\n\nRemark 2.4. One way of thinking about the Dirac delta is as the limit of a Gaussian probability distribution centred at the origin when the variance tends to zero (i.e. when you “squeeze” it).\n\n\nProposition 2.1 The Dirac delta function satisfies:\n\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = f(x') \\delta(x' - x) {\\mathrm{d}}x' = f(x),\n\\delta ( a x ) = \\frac{1}{|a|} \\delta(x),\n\\int_{-\\infty}^x \\delta(x') {\\mathrm{d}}x' = H(x),\n\nwhere f(x) is any continuous function, a \\neq 0 is a constant and H(x) is the Heaviside step function.\n\nThe proofs for these properties follow immediately from Definition 2.8. We can generalise the definition of the Dirac delta function to higher dimensions\n\nDefinition 2.9 (Dirac delta function) The n-dimensional version Dirac delta function \\delta: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} is defined as\n \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\Pi_{i = 1}^n \\delta(x_i) = \\delta(x_1) \\delta(x_2) \\dots \\delta(x_n),\nwhere {\\boldsymbol{r}}= (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) in Cartesian coordinates.\n\n\nProposition 2.2 The Dirac delta function in n-dimensions satisfies the properties\n\n \\delta ({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = 0 \\quad \\text{ if } {\\boldsymbol{r}}\\neq {\\boldsymbol{0}},\n\\int_\\Omega \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}) {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } {\\boldsymbol{0}}\\in \\Omega,\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise},\\end{cases} \n\\int_\\Omega  f({\\boldsymbol{r}}') \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}' - {\\boldsymbol{r}}) {\\mathrm{d}}V = f({\\boldsymbol{r}}),\n\n\nLet’s now get back to the connection between point charges and charge densities. We can think of a point charge q at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 as a charge density\n\\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = q \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0). \\tag{2.14}\nSubstituting this definition in Equation 2.10 we obtain\n{\\boldsymbol{E}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega \\frac{q \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}' -{\\boldsymbol{r}}_0)}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|^2} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}-{\\boldsymbol{r}}'}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} {\\mathrm{d}}V' = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0|^2} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}-\\ bfr_0|},\nwhich corresponds to Equation 2.3 for a single point charge. We can proceed similarly for the electrostatic potential.\nFor the Gauss’ law, we can substitute Equation 2.14 into Equation 2.12 and obtain\n\\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_\\Omega q \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0) {\\mathrm{d}}V = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0},\nas, by assumption, {\\boldsymbol{r}}_0 \\in \\Omega.

Then, we can compute the work5 done against the electrostatic force for a charge q moving along a path C starting at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{i} and ending at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{f} is\n W = - \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{F}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{s}}= - q \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{s}}= q \\int_C \\nabla \\phi \\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{s}}= q ( \\phi ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{f} - \\phi ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_\\mathrm{i}))). \\tag{2.16}\nTherefore, we deduce that the work done does not depend on the path C, only on its start and end points, and we can conclude that the electrostatic force is conservative.\n\nRemark 2.5. Note that the electrostatic potential is defined up to a constant. This means that, if \\phi is a potential for a given electric field {\\boldsymbol{E}}, then \\hat{\\phi} = \\phi + c (where c is a constant) is also a potential for {\\boldsymbol{E}}. Therefore, the quantity that is well-defined (and we can measure) physically is the potential difference between two points, which we call voltage.\nWhen working with electrostatic potentials, it is up to us to define a reference for the potential, that is the value of the potential at a given point, which allows us to fix the constant. For example, in Definition 2.4 we assumed that the potential is zero as |{\\boldsymbol{r}}| \\to \\infty.\n\n\nDefinition 2.10 (Field lines) Given a vector field, a field line is a line that at each point is tangent to the vector field.6\n\nField lines are a very useful way to visualise electric (and magnetic) fields.\n\nDefinition 2.11 (Equipotential surfaces) Surfaces of constant \\phi are called equipotentials.7\n\n\nProposition 2.4 The electric field (i.e. the field lines) are always normal to an equipotential surface.\n\n\nProof. Define {\\boldsymbol{t}} to be a tangent vector to the equipotential at a given point {\\boldsymbol{r}}. From the definition of the equipotential, we know that the derivative of \\phi in the tangent direction {\\boldsymbol{t}} must be zero (as the potential is constant along an equipotential surface). Thus (\\nabla \\phi) \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{t}}= 0 and from the definition of the electrostatic potential we conclude that {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot \\nabla \\phi = 0 so the electric field is perpendicular to the equipotential surface (and so are the field lines).",

    "text": "2.6 Electrostatic energy\nTo finish this chapter on electrostatics, let’s talk about the electrostatic energy. Note that the electrostatic potential at a given point can be interpreted as the potential energy required to bring a unit charge to that point from some reference point (usually infinity).\nHowever, we want to extend this concept from a single charge to any electrostatic configuration. As usual, let’s start considering point charges to build intuition about the general form. We start with a charge q_1 at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1. Its potential is\n \\phi_1 = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1|}. \nNow let’s consider a charge q_2, which we move from infinity to a point {\\boldsymbol{r}}_2. From Equation 2.16, the work done against the electric field is\n W_2 = q_2 \\phi_1({\\boldsymbol{r}}_2) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_2 q_1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_2 - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1|}.\nLet’s now do the same for a charge q_3 that needs to be placed at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_3, in the presence of q_1 and q_2:\nW_3 = q_3 (\\phi_1 ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_3) + \\phi_2 ({\\boldsymbol{r}}_3)) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q_3 q_1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_3 - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1} + \\frac{q_3 q_2}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_3 - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_2|} \\right),\nwhich we deduce fro the principle of superposition (\\phi_2 is the potential of the charge q_2). The total work done so far is W = W_2 + W_3. By induction, we can deduce that for N charges q_1, \\dots, q_N at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_1,\\dots,{\\boldsymbol{r}}_N the total work to assemble them is\n W = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j &lt; i} \\frac{q_i q_j}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_i - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_j|}.\nBy symmetry on i and j, we can write\nW = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{q_i q_j}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_i - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_j|}.\nRewriting it in terms of electrostatic potentials we get\nW = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i \\phi^{(i)}, \\tag{2.17}\nwhere\n\\phi^{(i)} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{q_j}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}_i - {\\boldsymbol{r}}_j|} \\tag{2.18}\nis defined as the potential generated by all charges except for q_i evaluated at {\\boldsymbol{r}}_i.\nNow let’s take the continuum limit, to consider the potential created by a charge density instead (Equation 2.11). Then Equation 2.17 becomes\nW = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_\\Omega \\rho \\phi {\\mathrm{d}}V.\nUsing Gauss’ law (#eq-Gauss-law-charge-density) and some basic vector calculus identities, we obtain\n\\phi \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} = \\phi \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}) - \\nabla \\phi \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}) + {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot (\\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}) + | {\\boldsymbol{E}}|^2.\nSubstituting into Equation 2.18 and using the divergence theorem we get\nW = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2} \\left( \\int_\\Sigma \\phi {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A + \\int_\\Omega  \n| {\\boldsymbol{E}}|^2 {\\mathrm{d}}V \\right). \\tag{2.19}\nAs we want to know the energy of the whole charge configuration, we take \\Omega to be a ball centred at the origin with radius r.

    "text": "3.1 Electric current & conservation of charge\nSo far we have considered situations where charges are static, so the next step is to consider what happens when charges move around. However, when charges move around, they create magnetic fields! This can create some quite interesting (and messy) interactions between electric and magnetic fields. We will unpick this little by little starting with magnetostatics, that is the study of magnetic fields that do not depend on time.\nConsider a point charge. It’s pretty straightforward to picture this charge moving around the space with a velocity {\\boldsymbol{v}}(t). Let’s now think what would happen when we have infinitely many charges, so we consider a charge density \\rho({\\boldsymbol{r}}). Similarly, we can define a velocity field {\\boldsymbol{v}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}, t), which gives us the average1 drift velocity of a charge at point {\\boldsymbol{r}} and time t. In this chapter we focus on time independent problems, so we drop time, i.e. {\\boldsymbol{v}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}). This means that the charges can still move around, but the velocity does not change in time (though it can change in space). In short, the charge at a position {\\boldsymbol{r}} will always have the same velocity {\\boldsymbol{v}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}).\nIf you stop to consider what are the dimensions of the current density, you will find that they are charge per unit time and unit area2. It is therefore a flux, that is (in very rigorous terms) amount of stuff through a surface per unit time, where in this case stuff is charge.\nIt is convenient to define electric current (or current, for short).\nThe physical interpretation of the current is the amount of charge per unit time flowing through the surface \\Sigma. Therefore, current is not a vector quantity but a scalar. Depending on which way we define the normal vector {\\boldsymbol{n}}, we may have positive or negative current. This arbitrarity is fine: we basically define a direction for current and, if it ends up being negative, it means charge is flowing in the opposite direction.\nYou are probably familiar with the idea of current when you think of electric cables. Charges inside might be doing all sorts of things, but what matters in the end is how much charge gets through the cross-section of the cable, i.e. the current.\nA very important property of electric charge is that it is conserved. Like with mass, this means that charge cannot be created nor destroyed. The idea of conservation of stuff underpins many areas of physics3 and, luckily for us, we have a very convenient way of representing it mathematically.\nThe equation that encapsulates conservation of stuff is called the continuity equation. Even though it is a very general equation, here we will state it and derive it in the context of electric fields.4\nIn magnetostatics we have \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0, therefore the continuity equation reduces to\n\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{J}}= 0. \\tag{3.3}\nCurrents satisfying this property are called steady currents.",

For the remaining term, we can use divergence theorem:\n -\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\int_\\Omega \\nabla' \\left( \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{J}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}')}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} \\right) {\\mathrm{d}}V' = -\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{J}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}')}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|} \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A'.\nBut, by definition, {\\boldsymbol{J}} is supported inside \\Omega, therefore the boundary integral vanishes and we conclude\n\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}= 0.\n\n\nProof (of Ampère’s law). From Lemma 3.1 we have\n\\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}).\nUsing the identity CROSSREF, which applies to any vector field {\\boldsymbol{A}}, we obtain\n \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}) = \\nabla (\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}) - \\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}.\nApplying Lemma 3.2 we deduce\n\\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}= -\\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}.\nNow we only need to compute \\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}} from Equation 3.5:\n\\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}= \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int_\\Omega {\\boldsymbol{J}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}') \\nabla^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{|{\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}'|}\\right) {\\mathrm{d}}V' = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\int_\\Omega {\\boldsymbol{J}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}') \\left(- 4 \\pi \\delta({\\boldsymbol{r}}- {\\boldsymbol{r}}') \\right) {\\mathrm{d}}V' = - \\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}).\nWe have used CROSSREF in the second step.\nCombining everything we conclude\n \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}}, \\tag{3.6}\nwhich is Ampère’s law (Theorem 3.3).\n\n\nCorollary 3.1 (Ampère’s law - alternative formulation) For any simple8 closed curve C = \\partial \\Sigma bounding a surface \\Sigma\n \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{r}}= \\mu_0 \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A = \\mu_0 I,\nwhere I is the current through \\Sigma.\n\n\nExample 3.2 (Straight wire – 2) Let’s consider again the current through a straight wire (Example 3.1), but now let’s approach it using Corollary 3.1. If we look at the symmetries of the problem, we notice it is invariant under vertical translations and rotations around the z-axis, so we can conclude that the magnetic field only depends on the radial direction. Let’s further assume that the only non-zero component is on the angular direction:\n {\\boldsymbol{B}}= B(r) {\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\theta.\nFor our curve C we choose a circle of arbitrary radius r in the x-y plane with the centre on the z axis. Corollary 3.1 gives\n \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{r}}= B(r) \\int_0^{2\\pi} r {\\mathrm{d}}\\theta = 2 \\pi R B(r) = \\mu_0 I,\ntherefore we conclude that\n {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi r} {\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\theta.",

    "text": "3.6 Magnetostatic vector potential\nIn the derivation of Ampère’s law we introduced the vector field {\\boldsymbol{A}}, purely for convenience. It turns out though, that there is a lot more to it.\n\nDefinition 3.5 (Magnetostatic vector potential) The vector potential of a static magnetic field {\\boldsymbol{B}} is defined as vector field {\\boldsymbol{A}} such that\n {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}.\n\nNote the parallelisms (and differences) with the electrostatic potential in Section 2.5. There, we had a scalar potential \\phi from which we computed the electric field as {\\boldsymbol{E}}= -\\nabla \\phi. Now, we have a vector potential9 {\\boldsymbol{A}} from which we compute the magnetic field {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}.\nNote as well that by defining the magnetic field from the vector potential it automatically satisfies \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{B}}= 0, as the divergence of a curl is always zero. The implication works both ways and any field {\\boldsymbol{B}} that can be written as the curl of a potential satisfies \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{B}}= 0. CROSSREF\nThe choice for {\\boldsymbol{A}} is far from unique, similarly to the definition of the electric potential. In this case, the argument is a bit more subtle, as we can not only add constants, but also vector fields of the form \\nabla \\chi (for a given function \\chi({\\boldsymbol{x}})):\n{\\boldsymbol{A}}' = {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\nabla \\chi \\implies \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\chi) = \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}.\n\nDefinition 3.6 (Gauge transformation) The transformation\n {\\boldsymbol{A}}\\rightarrow {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\nabla \\chi\nfor any given function \\chi is called a gauge transformation.\n\n\nProposition 3.1 We can always find a gauge transformation \\chi such that {\\boldsymbol{A}}' satisfies\n\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = 0.\nSuch transformation is called Coulomb gauge.\n\n\nProof. Suppose that we have a vector field {\\boldsymbol{A}} already satisfying \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}= {\\boldsymbol{B}}, but with \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}= \\psi({\\boldsymbol{x}}).\nConsider the transformed vector field {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\nabla \\chi, taking the divergence we obtain\n\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\nabla^2 \\chi = \\psi + \\nabla^2 \\chi.\nThen, to make \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = 0 we simply need to choose \\chi such that\n\\nabla^2 \\chi = - \\psi.\nThis is the Poisson equation, and we know that it has a unique solution (up to an additive constant).\n\nThere is a lot to unpack from gauges when one goes into quantum physics (in fact, there is a class of quantum field theories called gauge theories). However, in this module we will use gauges purely as a mathematical tool: choosing the right gauge allows us to write equations in a simpler form. For example, Ampère’s law for the vector field yields\n\\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}}= \\nabla \\times \\left( \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}\\right) = \\nabla (\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}) - \\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}},\nand taking the Coulomb gauge allows us to simplify the equation to\n \\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}= - \\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}},\nwhich is the Poisson’s equation and we know how to solve it.\n\nExample 3.3 (Straight wire – 3) Let’s consider yet again the current through a straight wire (Example 3.1). Now we want to compute the vector potential {\\boldsymbol{A}}. We found out in the previous examples that\n {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi r} {\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\theta.\nAs {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}, we can write the following system of equations for the components of {\\boldsymbol{A}}:\n \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{\\partial A_\\theta}{\\partial z} = 0,\n \\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi r},\n\\frac{1}{r} \\left(\\frac{\\partial (r A_\\theta)}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial A_r}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) = 0.\nIt is not straightforward how to solve this equation, but we can construct a suitable solution (remember, it will not be unique) by taking\n{\\boldsymbol{A}}= - \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi} \\log \\left(  \\frac{r}{r_0} \\right) {\\boldsymbol{e}}_z,\nwhere r_0 is an integrating constant.",

We could already infer from the stationary Maxwell’s equations that there are some connections between electric and magnetic fields: they are both produced by electric charges, the former by their existence, the latter by their motion.\nHowever, the interaction between electric and magnetic fields is much deeper, and this is only apparent when we let them change in time. This is the focus of this chapter.\nLet’s first consider how Equation 2.15 is modified when we allow both {\\boldsymbol{E}} and {\\boldsymbol{B}} to change in time. This is given by the Faraday’s law1.\nLet’s now introduce a couple of useful definitions.\nThen, Faraday’s law can be rewritten as\n\\mathcal{E}_\\mathrm{emf} = - \\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}\\Phi}{{\\mathrm{d}}t}.\nThis is simply a change in notation, but you may encounter this form in books.\nFaraday’s law tells us that if we change the magnetic flux through \\Sigma then we will induce a current. There are multiple ways of doing so physically. For example, one could change the magnetic field (e.g. by moving a magnet around) or maybe change the surface \\Sigma (e.g. by moving the wires enclosing it). There is another effect though. When a current flows in a wire, it will create its own magnetic field that will oppose the change that has induced the current in the first place. This is called Lenz’s law.\nWe can illustrate it as follows:\n\\text{change in } {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\xrightarrow[]{\\text{Faraday}} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\xrightarrow[]{\\text{Lorentz}} \\text{current} \\xrightarrow[]{\\text{Ampère}} {\\boldsymbol{B}}.",

This is not an actual proof, but we will show it for a particular case to get the idea. Generalising the proof is much trickier and out of the scope of this module.\nConsider the electric and magnetic fields generated by a set of charges moving with constant velocity {\\boldsymbol{v}} (i.e. moving along a straight line with constant speed). By the Lorentz force law (Definition 3.3), an observer that is not moving will measure a following force over a charge q:\n {\\boldsymbol{F}}= q {\\boldsymbol{E}}+ q {\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}.\nNow consider an observer moving with the same constant velocity {\\boldsymbol{v}} as the charges. To that observer, the charges will look static and thus will only produce an electric field {\\boldsymbol{E}}'. They will measure a force over a charge q\n {\\boldsymbol{F}}' = q {\\boldsymbol{E}}'.\nNow since we assume the two observer should be measuring the same force2 we must have\n {\\boldsymbol{E}}' = {\\boldsymbol{E}}+ {\\boldsymbol{v}}\\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}. \nFor the second observer, the electric field is static, so Equation 2.15 applies.

To do this, let’s start with its integral form (Corollary 3.1):\n \\int_C {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{r}}= \\mu_0 \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A.\nRemember that C is a simple closed curve bounding \\Sigma.

Then\n0 = \\int_\\Sigma {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A - \\int_{\\Sigma'} {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A = \\int_S {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}A, \\tag{4.2}\nwhere S = \\Sigma \\cup \\Sigma' is a closed surface.

Then, we can write\n\\int_S {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{J}}{\\mathrm{d}}V = 0,\nwhere we have applied the divergence theorem in the first equality and the steady current condition (Equation 3.3). But let’s now drop the static assumption. In that case, we need to use Equation 3.1 instead, so\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\int_S {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{J}}{\\mathrm{d}}V &= - \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} {\\mathrm{d}}V \\\\\n&= - \\epsilon_0 \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\right) {\\mathrm{d}}V \\\\\n&= - \\epsilon_0 \\int_S \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t} \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A \\\\\n&= -\\epsilon_0 \\int_\\Sigma \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t} \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A + \\epsilon_0 \\int_{\\Sigma'} \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t} \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A,\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere we have used the continuity equation in the second line (Equation 3.1) and Gauss’ law (Equation 2.13) in the third line, before applying the divergence theorem again and splitting the surface integral over S back into \\Sigma and \\Sigma'.\nWe conclude that\n\\int_\\Sigma \\left( {\\boldsymbol{J}}+ \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t} \\right) \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A = \\int_{\\Sigma'} \\left( {\\boldsymbol{J}}+ \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t} \\right) \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{n}}\\; {\\mathrm{d}}A,\nwhich suggests we can write Ampère’s law Equation 3.6 as\n \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\mu_0 \\left( {\\boldsymbol{J}}+ \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t}\\right).\nThis is one of the Maxwell’s equation (Equation 1.4). This extra term that we picked up, {\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t}, is called the displacement current.\nThere is a quite interesting historical note about this equation. While the other three Maxwell’s equations (and the static version of Ampère’s law) were discovered mostly through experiments (even though mathematicians were still needed to write them as equations), the displacement current term Equation 1.4 was discovered purely by reasoning by Maxwell, and that’s probably why all four equations are now named after him. Moreover, the displacement current must be included, otherwise the equations are not consistent, but we will discuss this in the next section.",

Recall the values for the constants\n\\epsilon_0 \\approx 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\; \\mathrm{C}^2 \\, \\mathrm{N}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_0 \\approx 1.257 \\times 10^{-6} \\; \\mathrm{N} \\, \\mathrm{A}^{-2},\nso the value of c is\nc \\approx 2.99 \\times 10^{8} \\; \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1},\nwhich is the speed of light!\n\nPolarisation",

    "text": "4.5 Electromagnetic potentials and gauge transformations\nWe also need to think on how the introduction of the time dependency affects the electric and magnetic potentials we introduced in Definition 2.4 and Definition 3.5.\nSince Equation 4.4 still holds, we can define the magnetic potential {\\boldsymbol{A}}({\\boldsymbol{r}}, t) as\n {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{A}}. \\tag{4.7}\nUsing Equation 4.5 we obtain\n0  = \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{E}}+ \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{B}}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times \\left( {\\boldsymbol{E}}+ \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t} \\right).\nTherefore, we can introduce a scalar potential \\phi({\\boldsymbol{r}}, t) such that\n{\\boldsymbol{E}}+ \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\phi.\nThen, the electric field can be in terms of both potentials as\n{\\boldsymbol{E}}= - \\nabla \\phi - \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t}. \\tag{4.8}\n\nDefinition 4.3 (Gauge transformation) The transformations\n {\\boldsymbol{A}}\\rightarrow {\\boldsymbol{A}}' = {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\nabla \\chi, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\phi \\rightarrow \\phi' = \\phi - \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial t} \nfor any given function \\chi are called a gauge transformations. These can be seen as a generalisation of Definition 3.6, and they leave Equation 4.7 and Equation 4.8 invariant.\n\n\nDefinition 4.4 (Lorenz gauge) The Lorenz7 gauge for {\\boldsymbol{A}} and \\phi is the condition\n\\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}= 0.\n\nThis is analogous to the Coulomb gauge (Proposition 3.1), and it will allow us to choose a form for \\chi so we can write Equation 4.7 and Equation 4.8 in a more convenient form.\n\nTheorem 4.2 In Lorenz gauge, Maxwell’s equations can be written as\n\\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0},\n\\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t^2} - \\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}= \\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}}.\n\n\nProof. Taking Equation 4.3 and plugging in Equation 4.8,\n \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} = \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}= \\nabla \\cdot \\left( - \\nabla \\phi - \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t} \\right) = - \\nabla^2 \\phi + \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial t},\nwhere in the last step we have used the Lorenz gauge.\nSimilarly, taking Equation 4.6 and substituting Equation 4.7, we obtain\n \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}= \\nabla \\left(\\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}\\right) - \\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}= \\mu_0 \\left[ {\\boldsymbol{J}}- \\epsilon_0 \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\nabla \\phi + \\frac{\\partial^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t^2} \\right) \\right].\nBut from Lorenz gauge we have\n\\nabla \\left( \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{A}}\\right) = - \\epsilon_0 \\mu_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\nabla \\phi,\ntherefore we can write\n-\\nabla^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}+ \\frac{1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 {\\boldsymbol{A}}}{\\partial t^2} = \\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}}.",

    "text": "4.6 Electromagnetic energy and the Poynting vector\nElectromagnetic waves carry energy. In fact, most of the energy we get in the Earth comes, in origin, from the light of the Sun. The aim of this section is to calculate this energy.\n\nDefinition 4.5 (Electromagnetic energy density) The electromagnetic energy density for a given field is\n\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}{\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{E}}+ \\frac{1}{2 \\mu_0} {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{B}}.\n\nDo not confuse the electromagnetic energy density \\mathcal{E} with the electromotive force \\mathcal{E}_\\mathrm{emf}. In fact, the latter will not appear again in these notes.\n\nTheorem 4.3 (Poynting’s theorem) The electromagnetic energy density \\mathcal{E} satisfies\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{S}}= - {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{J}}, \\tag{4.9}\nwhere\n{\\boldsymbol{S}}= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\times {\\boldsymbol{B}},\nis called the Poynting vector.\n\n\nProof. From Definition 4.5, taking the time derivative of the electromagnetic energy density we obtain\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{E}}{\\partial t} &= \\epsilon_0 {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{E}}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial {\\boldsymbol{B}}}{\\partial t}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot \\left( \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}- \\mu_0 {\\boldsymbol{J}}\\right) - \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\cdot \\left( \\nabla \\times {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\right) \\\\\n&= - \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\times {\\boldsymbol{B}}\\right) - {\\boldsymbol{E}}\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{J}},\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwhere in the second line we have used Equation 4.5 and Equation 4.6, and the third line uses CROSSREF.\n\nNote that that Equation 4.9 is analogous to Equation 3.1. Therefore, one can continue the analogy, and say that the Poynting vector {\\boldsymbol{S}} is to the electromagnetic energy density \\mathcal{E}, what the current density {\\boldsymbol{J}} is to the charge density \\rho. In other words, {\\boldsymbol{S}} is the flow of energy carried by the electromagnetic field. In the particular case where there are no currents, Equation 4.9 states that the electromagnetic energy is conserved. There is another interpretation of the Poynting vector though: it is the momentum stored in the electromagnetic field.",
