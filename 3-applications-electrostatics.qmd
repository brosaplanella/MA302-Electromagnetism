# Applications of electrostatics {#sec-applications-electrostatics}

In the previous chapter we introduced some machinery to understand electrostatics. The aim of this chapter is to put this machinery to work, so we can use it to understand some of the phenomena we see and experience in our day-to-day lives.

## Equilibrium in an electrostatic field

Let's first consider whether we can reach equilibrium in an electrostatic field, i.e. can we "trap" an electric charge at a given point just by placing other charges in the right places? To be precise, by "trap" we mean that the charge will lie in stable equilibrium at that point, meaning that if we slightly perturb it, it will go back to place (instead of flying away). We also do not consider the case where two charges lie on top of each other, which would actually give us equilibrium.

::: {#exm-equilibrium-charges}

Consider two point charges of charge $q$ located at $\bfr_+=(1,0)$ and $\bfr_-=(-1,0)$, respectively.^[For simplicity, we constrain ourselves to the 2D case.] We assume these charges remain fixed in place somehow. By the principle of superposition, the electric field generated by these two charges is

$$\bfE(\bfr) = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{\bfr - \bfr_+}{|\bfr - \bfr_+|^3} + \frac{\bfr - \bfr_-}{|\bfr - \bfr_-|^3} \right).$$

Now let's introduce another charge $q$ at the origin. The force this charge will experience is 

$$\bfF = q \bfE (\bfzero) = \bfzero,$$

so the new charge will remain at the origin (no force acting on it). However, if we perturb the charge position, for example placing it at $(0, \delta)$, where $\delta > 0$ is a small quantity, the force becomes

$$ \bfF = \left( 0, \frac{q^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\delta}{(1 + \delta^2)^\frac{3}{2}}\right), $$ 

and thus the charge will be pushed upwards, away from the origin. Therefore, we found an equilibrium point, but not a stable one, not meeting our definition of "trapping".
:::

You can try as hard as you want to find a charge arrangement that would give us electrostatic equilibrium, but it is actually impossible. Let's prove it by assuming otherwise and reaching a contradiction.

Assume there is a charge configuration in which there is a point in empty space $\bfr_*$ that is stable for a charge $q$ (wlog^[wlog = without loss of generality.] we assume $q > 0$). Empty space means that the charge density is zero in a neighbourhood of $\bfr_*$. As the point is stable, if we place the particle slightly off $\bfr_*$ it should be pushed back into position by the electric field. Therefore the particle should see an inwards force towards $\bfr_*$. Therefore, for an arbitrary surface $\Sigma$ surrounding $\bfr_*$ and contained in the free space, we must have

$$ \int_\Sigma \bfE \cdot \bfn \; \dd A < 0.$$

However, by Gauss' law, the right-hand side must be proportional to the charge contained within $\Sigma$, which we assumed was zero. This is a contradiction, and therefore electrostatic equilibrium is not possible.

Note that, by using forces other than the electrostatic ones, one can construct equilibrium configurations. For example, in @exm-equilibrium-charges, if we constrain the new charge to lie in the horizontal axis (by imposing some sort of force), then we have a stable configuration as for a small displacement $\delta$ along the horizontal axis (in either direction) will result into a force in the horizontal direction with magnitude

$$F = -\frac{q}{\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\delta}{(\delta - 1)^2 (\delta + 1)^2},$$

pushing the charge back to the origin.


## Conductors {#sec-conductors}

Let's now talk about conductors.

::: {#def-conductor}

## Electrical Conductor

An _electrical conductor_ (or conductor, in short) is a material in which some charges are free to move (e.g. electrons in a metal). We will describe it mathematically as a given region in space that contains charges which can move freely.^[The conductor might also contain some immobile charges.]

:::

The are several consequences stemming from this definition, let's unpack them one by one. 

::: {#prp-E0-inside-conductor}

In a static configuration, the electric field inside a conductor is equal to zero, i.e. $\bfE \equiv \bfzero$.

:::

::: {.proof}

If the electric field inside the conductor was non-zero, any charges inside would move, but we do not allow it as we are considering a static configuration.
:::

From @prp-E0-inside-conductor, we can deduce a series of corollaries.

::: {#cor-constant-potential-conductor}
The electrostatic potential $\phi$ inside a conductor must be constant (proof follows directly from the definition of $\phi$).
:::

::: {#cor-charge-conductor}
The charge density inside the conductor must be identically zero, i.e. $\rho \equiv 0$ (proof follows directly from Gauss' law). Therefore, any net charge of a conductor must sit at its surface.
:::

::: {#cor-equipotential-surface-conductor}
The surface of the conductor is an equipotential (proof follows directly from $\phi = \text{const}$). Therefore, the electric field is perpendicular to the surface, which agrees with the fact that surface charges must be static.
:::

The physical interpretation of these results is that, when a conductor is in the presence of an electric field, its free charges will rearrange in such a way (across the conductor surface) so they cancel out the electric field inside of the conductor.

All this naturally leads to the introduction of _surface charges_. Similar to the charge density $\rho$, which is defined as charge per unit of volume, we can define the surface charge density $\sigma$ as the charge per unit of area. Then, we can naturally extend @def-electric-field-charge-density for a charge density $\sigma$ on a surface $\Sigma$ as

$$
\bfE(\bfr) = \bfE (\bfr) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_\Sigma \frac{\sigma(\bfr')}{|\bfr - \bfr'|^2} \frac{\bfr - \bfr'}{|\bfr - \bfr'|} \dd A'.
$$ {#eq-electric-field-surface-charge-density}

However, now the electric field has some interesting properties.

::: {#prp-jump-electric-field}

Consider the electric field @eq-electric-field-surface-charge-density generated by a surface charge density $\sigma$ on a surface $\Sigma$. Then the electric field $\bfE$ must be continuous across $\Sigma$ in the tangential direction, but not in the normal direction.

In particular, the discontinuity can be written as

$$\bfE^+ \cdot \bfN - \bfE^- \cdot \bfn = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}.$$ {#eq-jump-electric-field}

Here the subscripts $+$ and $-$ represent different sides of the surface (arbitrarily labelled), and $\bfn$ is the normal unit vector to the surface pointing into the $+$ side.

Diagrams for the (a) Gaussian cylinder and the (b) loop used for the proof.
:::

Let's start with the discontinuity in the normal direction. Consider a small cylinder $\Omega$ of height $\delta H$ and cross-sectional area $\delta A$. For simplicity we will assume that, as outlined in @fig-pillbox, in the region of interest $\Sigma$ is flat, the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the surface, and the surface intersects the cylinder at its midpoint; but the same argument holds for more generic situations.^[This is usually known as a Gaussian cylinder or Gaussian pillbox.] By Gauss' law

$$ \int_{\partial \Omega} \bfE \cdot \bfn \; \dd A = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0},$$ {#eq-Gauss-law-cylinder}

where, remember, $Q$ is the total charge inside the cylinder $\Omega$. Let's now decompose the surface of the cylinder into three surfaces: the "top lid" $\partial \Omega^+$, the "bottom lid" $\partial \Omega^-$, and the side $\partial \Omega_\mathrm{side}$. We can split the integral into

$$ \int_{\partial \Omega} \bfE \cdot \bfn \; \dd A = \int_{\partial \Omega^+} \bfE \cdot \bfn^+ \; \dd A + \int_{\partial \Omega^-} \bfE \cdot \bfn^- \; \dd A + \int_{\partial \Omega_\mathrm{side}} \bfE \cdot \bfn_\mathrm{side} \; \dd A.$$

Now we take the limit $\delta \to 0$ (i.e. we collapse the cylinder onto the surface). Then, the side component vanishes, and the top and bottom lid collapse into each other (and onto the surface). We can rewrite @eq-Gauss-law-cylinder as

$$\int_{\partial \Omega^+} \bfE \cdot \bfn^+ \; \dd A + \int_{\partial \Omega^-} \bfE \cdot \bfn^- \; \dd A = \int_{\partial \Omega^+} \left(\bfE^+ \cdot \bfn^+\right) - \left(\bfE^- \cdot \bfn^+\right) \; \dd A,$$

where we have used that $\partial \Omega^+ \equiv \partial \Omega^-$ but $\bfn^+ = - \bfn^-$. The total charge $Q$ is given by

$$ Q = \int_{\partial \Omega^+} \sigma \dd A,$$

so combining everything we obtain

$$ \int_{\partial \Omega^+} \left(\bfE^+ \cdot \bfn^+\right) - \left(\bfE^- \cdot \bfn^+\right) \; \dd A = \int_{\partial \Omega^+} \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \dd A.$$

As this equality must hold for any cylinder $\Omega$, we conclude that

$$\bfE^+ \cdot \bfN - \bfE^- \cdot \bfn = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}.$$

Now let's show that $\bfE$ must be continuous in the tangential direction. Consider, instead, the rectangular loop $C$ in @fig-curve, with height $\delta H$ and width $\delta L$. The surface enclosed by the loop is defined as $S$. We compute the integral of $E$ around the loop and apply Stokes' theorem:

$$\int_C \bfE \cdot \bft \; \dd s = \int_S \left( \nabla \times \bfE \right) \cdot \bfn \; \dd A.$$

But from @eq-curl-E-zero we have that $\nabla \times \bfE = \bfzero$ so the integral needs to be equal to zero. By taking $\delta \to 0$ and applying a similar argument as we did with the cylinder, we obtain

$$\bfE^+ \cdot \bft - \bfE^- \cdot \bft = 0,$$

and thus $\bfE$ is continuous in the tangential direction.

:::

::: {#rem-line-charge-density}
Similarly to a surface charge density, we can define a line charge density $\lambda$, where represents the charge per unit length along a line.
:::

### Examples

::: {#exm-line-charge}

## Line charge

::: {#fig-line-charge}

![](./figs/line_charge.svg)

Diagram of the Gaussian surface used to compute the electric field of a line charge.
:::

Consider an infinitely long line charge distribution, with charge density $\lambda$. We want to compute the electric field it produces. We will work in cylindrical polar coordinates and, wlog, we will assume the charge is distribution along the $z$ axis (i.e. at $r = 0$). 

By symmetry, we can conclude that the electric field should only depend on the radial coordinate and, moreover, the only non-zero component of the electric field is also along the radial coordinate. Therefore $\bfE = E(r) \bfe_r$.

We will again use a Gaussian surface for the argument, but this time we take an arbitrary cylinder of radius $r$ and length $L$ with its axis along the $z$ axis, as shown in @fig-line-charge. By Gauss' law, we have

$$\int_{\partial \Omega} \bfE \cdot \bfn \; \dd A = E(r) 2 \pi r L =  \frac{\lambda L}{\epsilon_0},$$

and thus

$$E(r) = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}.$$

So we conclude that the electric field is given by 

$$\bfE = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r} \bfe_r.$$

::: {#exm-parallel-capacitor}

## Parallel plate capacitor

![Sketch of a parallel plate capacitor.](./figs/parallel_plate_capacitor.svg)
 
Let's now consider two flat parallel surfaces. We will take the plates to be perpendicular to the $x$ axis, and a distance $d$ apart. The plates have an area $A$, and we assume that $d \ll \sqrt{A}$, so we can ignore any effects arising from the edge of the plates^[To formalise this argument, you would need to do an asymptotic analysis similar to what you learned in [MA269 Asymptotics and Integral Transforms](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/currentstudents/modules/ma269/) (if you took it).].

Each plate has a total charge $Q$, but with opposite sign. Therefore, the surface charge distribution is defined as $\pm \sigma = \pm Q/A$. We know^[This is an exercise in the problem sheets.] that.b the electric field produced by an infinite plate with surface charge density $\sigma$ is uniform and perpendicular to the plate (pointing away from it) with magnitude

$$ \| \bfE \| = \pm \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0}.$$

Then, by superposition, the electric field produced by the two plates is

$$ \bfE = \begin{cases}
\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \bfe_x, & \text{between the plates},\\
\bfzero, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

This configuration is known as a capacitor, and it is typically used to store small amounts of energy (and many other things). We can then consider what's the electrostatic potential in the capacitor. As the electric field is only in the $x$ direction, we have

$$ \frac{\dd \phi}{\dd x} = - E \implies \phi = - \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} x + c,$$

where $c$ is an integration constant. We define the _voltage_ or _potential difference_ as the difference in potential between two points. In this case, the voltage between the two plates is

$$V = \phi(0) - \phi(d) = \frac{\sigma d}{\epsilon_0}.$$

We can then define the _capacitance_ $C$ of the capacitor as the charge in the capacitor divided by the potential difference:

$$C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{A \epsilon_0}{d}.$$

The capacitance is dictates how much energy the capacitor can store, from @def-energy-density:

$$W = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{2} \int_0^d \left( \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \right)^2 \dd x = \frac{Q^2}{2C}.$$

### Application: the Faraday cage

Let's use what we have learned about conductors to understand how a Faraday cage works. Let's consider a box made of a conducting material. Inside the box there are no charges. As shown in @fig-Faraday-cage, when we apply an electric field on the outside of the box, the charges on the box will redistribute to produce an electric field that will cancel out the field inside of the box. Therefore, anything or anyone inside the box is shielded from any external electric fields.

![Diagram of a Faraday cage in operation. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Condutor-electric-field-compensation.svg">MikeRun</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons](./figs/Faraday_cage.svg){#fig-Faraday-cage width=80%}

As the name suggests, though, Faraday cages are typically cages, not boxes, but the effect still holds. The mathematical analysis in that case is a bit more complicated, if you want to learn more, you can read this article by [Jon Chapman, Dave Hewett and Nick Trefethen](https://doi.org/10.1137/140984452).

Faraday cages play an important role in everyday life by shielding sensitive electronic devices from electromagnetic interference. A familiar example is the way cars act as Faraday cages, protecting occupants from lightning strikes during storms. Lightning is a sudden discharge between very strongly electrically charged areas (in this case, the clouds and the ground). Therefore, the lightning is just the consequence of a very strong electric field. This [video by Top Gear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve6XGKZxYxA) is an entertaining (though a bit dated now) demonstration about a car behaving like a Faraday cage.


## Boundary value problems

So far, we have considered problems where we are given a charge distribution $\rho$ everywhere in space, and we just computed the potential $\phi$ from @thm-electrostatic-potential-charge-density. Instead, we now want to consider situations where the charge distribution is given in a region of space $\Omega$ only, along with some conditions on the potential at the boundary $\partial \Omega$. This type of problems are called, quite naturally, boundary value problems. More intuitively, it means that we will assume we have an infinite source/sink of charges outside $\Omega$, and that they will do _whatever they need to do_ to satisfy the imposed boundary condition.

In practice, this means solving @prp-Poisson, i.e.

$$ \nabla ^ 2 \phi = - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0},$$ {#eq-Poisson-bis}

along with some boundary conditions. There are two types of boundary conditions we will consider.

::: {#def-Dirichlet}

## Dirichlet boundary conditions

The value of $\phi$ is fixed on $\partial \Omega$. Physically, this represents that the boundary is made of a conductive material.

:::

::: {#def-Neumann}

The value of $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n} = \nabla \phi \cdot \bfn$ is fixed on $\partial \Omega$. This is equivalent to fixing $\bfE \cdot \bfn$. Physically, this represents that the boundary is made of an insulating material.

:::

One could also mix the boundary conditions, having Dirichlet boundary conditions on part of the boundary and Neumann conditions in the rest. 

It's natural to wonder whether @eq-Poisson-bis with Dirichlet or Neumann (or mixed) boundary conditions has a unique solution. 

::: {#thm-unique-solution-Poisson}

The Poisson equation (@eq-Poisson-bis) with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions has a unique solution for $\phi$. For Neumann boundary conditions, this solution is defined up to an arbitrary (or unphysical) additive constant.

:::

::: {.proof}

Suppose that there are two solutions $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ to the problem. Now define the function $f = \phi_1 - \phi_2$. It should satisfy 

$$\nabla^2 f = 0$$ {#eq-f-Poisson-uniqueness}

with either zero Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.

Consider the identity 

$$ \nabla \cdot \left(f \nabla f \right) = |\nabla f |^2 + f \nabla^2 f,$$

which is basically a distributive property of the divergence. Multiplying @eq-f-Poisson-uniqueness by $f$ and integrating over $\Omega$ we get

$$ 0 = \int_\Omega f \nabla^2 f \dd V = \int_\Omega \left( \nabla \cdot \left(f \nabla f \right) - |\nabla f|^2 \right) \dd V = \int_{\partial \Omega} f \nabla f \cdot \bfn \; \dd A - \int_\Omega |\nabla f|^2 \dd V,$$

where in the last step we have used the divergence theorem on the first term in the integral. The surface integral that stems from it vanishes, as at the boundary either $f = 0$ or $\nabla f \cdot \bfn = 0$ (by the boundary conditions). Then, we conclude

$$\int_\Omega |\nabla f|^2 \dd V = 0,$$

and therefore we must have $\nabla f = \bfzero$ everywhere in $\Omega$, which means $f$ is constant. If we have Dirichlet boundary conditions (even if only at a subset of the boundary) we can conclude $f = 0$, if we have Neumann conditions everywhere, then we can't determine the value of the constant. However, this constant has no physical meaning (we can arbitrarily define the origin of the potential, as the only thing that matters are the potential differences).

:::

## Green's functions
Let's now discuss some methods to solve boundary value problems. We will start with Green's functions.

::: {#def-Green-function}

## Green's function

A _Green's function_ for Poisson's equation is a function $G(\bfr, \bfr')$ satisfying

$$\nabla'^2 G(\bfr, \bfr') = - 4 \pi \delta (\bfr - \bfr'),$$ {#eq-Green-function}

where $\bfr,\bfr' \in \Omega$. Note that the Laplacian $\nabla'^2$ is defined in terms of the prime variable. This means it does not affect $\bfr$, only $\bfr'$. 

:::

From @prp-del2-1-r we know that a particular solution to @eq-Green-function is

$$G(\bfr, \bfr') = \frac{1}{|\bfr - \bfr'|}.$$

Note, however, that this solution is not unique. The general solution to @eq-Green-function is any function 

$$G(\bfr, \bfr') = \frac{1}{|\bfr - \bfr'|} + F(\bfr, \bfr'),$$ {#eq-Green-function-F}

where $F(\bfr, \bfr')$ solves

$$\nabla'^2 F(\bfr, \bfr') = 0.$$

::: {#prp-Green-function-solution}

The solution of @eq-Poisson-bis in a region $\Omega$ can be written as

$$\phi(\bfr) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int_\Omega G(\bfr, \bfr') \rho (\bfr') \dd V' + \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\partial \Omega} \left( G(\bfr, \bfr') \frac{\partial \phi(\bfr')}{\partial n'} - \phi(\bfr') \frac{\partial G(\bfr,\bfr')}{\partial n'} \right) \dd A'.$$ {#eq-Green-function-solution}

:::

::: {.proof}

By the properties of the divergence (similar to the argument in the proof of @thm-unique-solution-Poisson), we have that

$$\phi(\bfr') \nabla'^2 G(\bfr, \bfr') - G(\bfr, \bfr') \nabla'^2 \phi(\bfr') = \nabla' \cdot\left(\phi(\bfr') \nabla' G(\bfr, \bfr') - G(\bfr, \bfr') \nabla' \phi(\bfr')\right).$$

Integrating over $\Omega$ and applying the divergence theorem on the right hand side we obtain

$$ \int_\Omega \left( \phi(\bfr') \nabla'^2 G(\bfr, \bfr') - G(\bfr, \bfr') \nabla'^2 \phi(\bfr') \right) \dd V' = \int_{\partial \Omega} \left( \phi(\bfr') \nabla' G(\bfr, \bfr') - G(\bfr, \bfr') \nabla' \phi(\bfr') \right) \cdot \bfn' \, \dd A'.$$

By @eq-Green-function and @eq-Poisson-bis we can rewrite the left hand side as

$$ \int_\Omega \left( \phi(\bfr') \nabla'^2 G(\bfr, \bfr') - G(\bfr, \bfr') \nabla'^2 \phi(\bfr') \right) \dd V' = -4 \pi \phi(\bfr) + \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int_\Omega G(\bfr, \bfr') \rho(\bfr') \dd V'. $$

After some manipulation, we conclude

$$\phi(\bfr) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int_\Omega G(\bfr, \bfr') \rho (\bfr') \dd V' + \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\partial \Omega} \left( G(\bfr, \bfr') \frac{\partial \phi(\bfr')}{\partial n'} - \phi(\bfr') \frac{\partial G(\bfr,\bfr')}{\partial n'} \right) \dd A',$$

where, for convenience, we have rewritten $\nabla'G(\bfr, \bfr') \cdot \bfn$ as $\frac{\partial G(\bfr,\bfr')}{\partial n'}$ and similarly for $\phi$.
:::

This result holds for any choice of the Green's function which, remember, is not uniquely defined. Therefore we will try to make a suitable choice that simplifies @eq-Green-function-solution. For example, note that the second integral requires both $\phi$ and $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n'}$. If we have Dirichlet boundary conditions we will have the former but not the latter, and viceversa for Neumann boundary conditions. Therefore our choice of $G$ will be aimed at eliminating the term for which we do not have information.

::: {#def-Green-function-Dirichlet}

For Dirichlet boundary conditions, it is convenient to choose the Green's function $G_D(\bfr, \bfr')$ to satisfy homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e.

$$G_D(\bfr, \bfr') = 0, \quad \text{for } \bfr' \in \partial \Omega, \; \bfr \in \Omega.$$

Then, @eq-Green-function-solution reduces to

$$\phi(\bfr) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int_\Omega G_D(\bfr, \bfr') \rho (\bfr') \dd V' - \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\partial \Omega} \phi(\bfr') \frac{\partial G_D(\bfr,\bfr')}{\partial n'} \dd A'.$$

:::

::: {#def-Green-function-Neumann}

For Neumann boundary conditions, it is convenient to choose the Green's function $G_N(\bfr, \bfr')$ to satisfy

$$\frac{\partial G_D}{\partial n'} = - \frac{4\pi}{A}, \quad \text{for } \bfr' \in \partial \Omega, \; \bfr \in \Omega,$$

where $A = \int_{\partial \Omega} \dd A'$ is the area of $\partial \Omega$. The reason for this choice is that the surface integral of $\frac{\partial G_D}{\partial n'}$ needs to be $4\pi$, otherwise @eq-Green-function would not be satisfied.

Then, @eq-Green-function-solution reduces to

$$\phi(\bfr) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \int_\Omega G_N(\bfr, \bfr') \rho (\bfr') \dd V' + \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\partial \Omega} G(\bfr, \bfr') \frac{\partial \phi(\bfr')}{\partial n'} \dd A' + \langle \phi \rangle,$$

where $\langle \phi \rangle = \frac{1}{A} \int_{\partial \Omega} \phi(\bfr') \dd A'$ is the average of $\phi$ over the surface. But remember from @thm-unique-solution-Poisson that for Neumann boundary conditions the solution is defined up to a constant, so we can arbitrarily set the value $\langle \phi \rangle$. Setting $\langle \phi \rangle = 0$ is usually a very reasonable choice.

:::

You may be wondering whether we can always find the Green's functions for the Dirichlet and Neumann case. This requires solving the Laplace's equation with the suitable boundary conditions to determine $F(\bfr, \bfr')$ in @eq-Green-function-F. This is possible as long as $\partial \Omega$ is "nice enough".^[In this module it will be "nice enough" unless otherwise stated. For example, $\partial \Omega$ being smooth is "nice enough".] We may not be able to write such solutions explicitly, unfortunately, but even in these cases, writing the solution as in @prp-Green-function-solution is useful to understand its behaviour.

## Method of images

If Green's functions allowed us to write down the solution for pretty much any boundary value problem, albeit usually not explicitly, the next method we will introduce is the opposite: it is a clever trick that will allow us to find explicit solutions to some simple (yet common and useful) charge configurations. This is called the _method of images_. 

Let's go back to the discrete case: imagine we have a set of charges $q_i$ at positions $\bfr_i \in \Omega$, for $i = 1 \dots N$. We can use superposition to compute the potential of the set from @eq-electrostatic-potential-point-charge, but this potential will (most likely) not satisfy the boundary conditions we would like to impose. The method of images consists on adding a set of _virtual charges_ outside the domain, such that the combined effect of the actual and virtual charges satisfies the required boundary condition.

This is much more easily explained through an example.

::: {#exm-method-images}

## Charged particle near a conducting plane

::: {#fig-method-images-setup}

![](./figs/method_of_images_setup.svg)

A grounded conductor on the left half-plane and a charge at $(d,0,0)$. To simplify the diagram, we show the slice $z=0$.
:::



Consider a grounded conductor that fills the left half of the space, i.e. we have $\phi = 0$ for $x \leq 0$. We place a charge $q$ at a point $(d, 0, 0)$, and we want to know what is the induced electrostatic potential for $x > 0$. The setup is shown in @fig-method-images-setup.

If the conductor was not there, we already know that the potential would be

$$\phi = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\sqrt{(x - d)^2 + y^2 + z^2}},$$

but this clearly does not satisfy the boundary condition at $x = 0$ as

$$\phi = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\sqrt{d^2 + y^2 + z^2}} \neq 0.$$

The clever trick is to assume the conductor is not there and, instead, place a charge $-q$ at $(-d, 0, 0)$. Then, the potential of the pair of charges is

$$\phi = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{\sqrt{(x - d)^2 + y^2 + z^2}} -  \frac{q}{\sqrt{(x + d)^2 + y^2 + z^2}}\right),$$

and we can easily check that it satisfies $\phi=0$ at $x = 0$. Now, of course this potential does not describe the actual potential of the conductor, but if we constrain ourselves to $x > 0$ this potential works just fine. That has a quick solution though, just define a piecewise potential that is zero if $x \leq 0$ and is the potential above otherwise.

This solution is extremely handy, and we can now use it to better understand how a charge behaves in the vicinity of a conductor. The first thing we can do is compute the electric field:

$$\bfE = - \nabla \phi = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{(x - d, y, z)}{\left( (x-d)^2 + y^2 + z^2 \right)^\frac{3}{2}} - \frac{(x + d, y, z)}{\left( (x+d)^2 + y^2 + z^2 \right)^\frac{3}{2}} \right), \quad \text{for} \; x > 0.$$

Now let's calculate the surface charge distribution. We need to use @prp-jump-electric-field. As our surface is the $y-z$ plane, the normal vector is $\bfn = \bfe_x$, so we only need the $x$-component of the electric field $E_x$. On the left of the boundary we have $\left. E^-_x \right|_{x=0} = 0$. On the right of the boundary we get from the expression above

$$\left. E^+_x \right|_{x=0} = - \frac{q}{2 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{d}{\left( d^2 + y^2 + z^2 \right)^\frac{3}{2}}.$$

Therefore, using @eq-jump-electric-field we get

$$\sigma = \epsilon_0 \left. E^+_x \right|_{x=0} = - \frac{q}{2 \pi} \frac{d}{\left( d^2 + y^2 + z^2 \right)^\frac{3}{2}},$$

which is shown in @fig-method-images-solution.

Finally, let's compute the force that the charge will experience from the conductor. We can again use the potential induced by our virtual charge to write

$$\bfF = \frac{-q^2}{16 \pi \epsilon_0 d^2} \bfe_x.$$

Therefore, the (actual) charge experiences an attractive force towards the conductor.

## Electric dipoles {#sec-electric-dipole}

Let's now introduce the _electric dipole_, which is going to be extremely handy in @sec-matter when we study how electric fields interact with matter. Consider two point charges with opposite sign, $\pm q$, with the separation between them defined by a vector $\bfd$. Now, let's take the limit $d = |\bfd| \to 0$, while we let $q \to \infty$ in such a way that the _electric dipole moment_ $\bfp = q \bfd$ remains constant. This is called an electric dipole.^[The concept of dipole might be familiar to you if you are taking MA3D1 Fluid Dynamics, as it appears in the potential flows chapter.] We can loosely interpret the dipole (and its moment) as a charge with an orientation.

Now let's compute the force that the dipole experiences from a given electric field $\bfE$. We start with the pair of charges (i.e. before taking the limit $d \to 0$). By the superposition principle the force is

$$\bfF = q \bfE \left(\bfr + \frac{\bfd}{2}\right) - q \bfE \left(\bfr - \frac{\bfd}{2}\right),$$

where, wlog, we have placed the charge $+q$ at $\bfr + \frac{\bfd}{2}$ and the charge $-q$ at $\bfr - \frac{\bfd}{2}$. Taking the Taylor expansion for small $d$ we obtain

$$\begin{aligned}
\bfF &= q \left( \bfE (\bfr) + \left(\frac{\bfd}{2} \cdot \nabla \right) \bfE + O(d^2) \right) - q \left( \bfE (\bfr) - \left(\frac{\bfd}{2} \cdot \nabla \right) \bfE + O(d^2) \right)\\
&= \left( q \bfd \cdot \nabla \right) \bfE(\bfr) + O(d^2),
\end{aligned}
$$

and when we take the limit $d \to 0$ (assuming $\bfp$ stays constant) we obtain

$$\bfF = (\bfp \cdot \nabla) \bfE.$$

As a side note, we can also consider the torque that the field exerts on the dipole around the point $\bfr$, which is

$$ \bftau = \frac{\bfd}{2} \times \left[ q \bfE \left(\bfr + \frac{\bfd}{2}\right) \right] - \frac{\bfd}{2} \times \left[ -q \bfE \left(\bfr - \frac{\bfd}{2}\right) \right] \to \bfp \times \bfE,$$

where we have skipped the details for the Taylor expansion and the limit $d \to 0$. Basically, this conveys the idea that the tendency of the dipoles will be to rotate until $\bfp$ and $\bfE$ are aligned. Interestingly if they point in the same direction we have a _stable equilibrium_, while if they point in opposite directions we have an _unstable equilibrium_. We omit the details here, but you can check it yourself thinking in which way does the torque operate when the angle between $\bfp$ and $\bfE$ is $\varepsilon \ll 1$ and $\pi - \varepsilon$.

An electric dipole also generates its own electric field. Similarly to how we constructed the force, we can conclude that the potential of a dipole with moment $\bfp$ placed at the origin is

$$\phi(\bfr)_\mathrm{dipole} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\bfp \cdot \bfr}{r^3}.$$
